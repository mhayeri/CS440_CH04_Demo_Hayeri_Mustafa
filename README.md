# CS440_CH04_Demo_Hayeri_Mustafa

For CS440 test My justification here

For this particular question I decided to choose the GNU General Public License v3.0.

The reason I decided to choose this license over the other options was because this license would allow me to share my software/code and also give other users the ability to freely use and change it without all the restrictions that come with the proprietary software. This license would allow other users to freely change the software and/or update the code in order to make it more efficient and by helping the creator debug their code. I believe that having the ability to allow other users to freely improve and collaborate on my software would lead to new innovations which would and can benefit many people. I believe this license is one of the better choices when compared to proprietary software because it is free and allows many others to contribute their own ideas and knowledge to help better your own software.
